# ✅ Setting Up a Daily Cron Job for Your Node.js Script

You’ve already set up your project directory and script (`sprout_april.js`). Now let’s configure a cron job to run it automatically every day. Below are step-by-step instructions along with commands you can copy and paste for your current environment.

---

## 1️⃣ Find the Node.js Path

Run the following command to find where Node.js is installed:

```bash
which node
```

It will return a path like `/usr/bin/node`. If it’s different on your system, use the correct path in the next steps.

---

## 2️⃣ Create a Shell Script to Run Your Node Script

Create a new shell script using `nano`:

```bash
nano ~/Automation-excel-daily/run-sprout.sh
```

Paste the following content into the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd ~/Automation-excel-daily
/usr/bin/node sprout_april.js >> ~/Automation-excel-daily/cron-sprout.log 2>&1
```

> ✅ **Note:** Replace `/usr/bin/node` with the path you found in step 1, if it’s different.

Save and exit:
- Press `Ctrl + O`, hit `Enter`, then `Ctrl + X`.

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/Automation-excel-daily/run-sprout.sh
```

---

## 3️⃣ Add the Cron Job

Open the crontab editor:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add the following line at the end to schedule the script to run daily at 2:30 AM:

```bash
30 2 * * * ~/Automation-excel-daily/run-sprout.sh
```

Save and exit the editor.

---

## 4️⃣ Verify the Cron Job

List the current cron jobs to confirm your new entry:

```bash
crontab -l
```

You should see the job you just added.

---

## 5️⃣ Check Logs After the First Run

Once the cron job executes (at 2:30 AM or after temporarily adjusting the time), check the output and any errors by running:

```bash
cat ~/Automation-excel-daily/cron-sprout.log
```

This will display the logs generated by your Node.js script.

---

This setup ensures your script runs reliably every day, and you can easily monitor its activity through the log file.
